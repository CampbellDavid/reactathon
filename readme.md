## Planning

-- BACKEND --

The backend of the app was developed first and formost using MongoDB. This was necessary in order for the functions to operate correctly and render properly on the front end. A first structure of the backend was developed and changes were made throughout the duration of the project as issues were discovered later and functionality was added.

-- FRONTEND --

The frontend was developed using React and axios for communication with the backend. We started developing the frontend on the second day of the project, in order to maxamize our time and use the time we had efficiently.

## Project Management

Day 1:

Day 2:
  - Began backend development
  - Seed development
  - Tests
  - Start of frontend development

Day 3:
